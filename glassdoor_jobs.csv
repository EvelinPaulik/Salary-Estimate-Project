Data Scientist,CA$58k-CA$90k (Glassdoor Est.),"Wanted: A Data visualisation expert who will help us transform customer data into actionable insight

PN is looking for an ambitious, persuasive data visualization guru who’s passionate about health, fitness and helping people live their best life.

Precision Nutrition is growing, and we need a results-driven business intelligence analyst to mine our customer data, develop analysis and deliver recommendations to product and digital marketing groups. As one of the largest nutrition coaching companies in the world, PN is bigger than it’s ever been — and it’s about to get bigger.

To help us scale, we need a data visualization specialist who knows how to synthesize data into plain English so we can help millions more people live healthier, happier lives.

Join our Adventure

We’re embarking on a new adventure, and we need a multi-talented data scientist to drive the analysis that strengthens our product offers

We’ve got an exciting journey ahead of us… Over the next 10 years, Precision Nutrition will be expanding its world-class education and coaching services into a wide range of new fields, including yoga, group exercise, sports coaching, athletics, manual therapy and more.

To help us reach our goals and keep us moving forward, we need a data scientist who knows how to distill complex data into actionable steps—and communicate it to the right people.

Who we’re looking for

A shrewd data hound with the ability to communicate clearly

You’re naturally curious. You have an inquisitive mind, and you’re always looking for hard numbers to uncover patterns and insights in the way people think and work. You want to know what makes people tick, and gaining a deep understanding of your customers drives you to develop innovative solutions to solve their problems.

You’re self-motivated. Once you are confident in what you need to do, you can run with it and don’t need a lot of direction. You have strong self-structure and discipline and have worked remotely either currently or in the past so you know the benefits and the challenges. At the same time, you don’t silo yourself, and are always eager to learn more and share with the team.

You’re results-driven and have a strong bias for action. You get energized by developing recommendations that improve our product, and you excel at understanding and optimizing the journey our customers go through. You excel at knowing how to prioritize, adapt quickly when the scope changes—because it often will—and juggle lots of moving parts.

You’re a confident decision maker. Since you’ll be collaborating with people across the organization, you’ll be taking in a lot of competing input and synthesizing that into a specific course of action. You aren’t afraid to take on the authority and accountability needed to make a decision and drive the plan forward in the way you think will have the biggest effect. You don’t water down the plan to please everyone.

You’re an excellent communicator. You know how to say it, write it and present it in both layman’s terms and a bit more formally if needed. You know how to be heard and energize people around you, even when you’re “managing up” and presenting recommendations to the board.

You’re a motivating, team-oriented, people person. Let’s face it, in order to get other people to execute on your projects, you must be able to easily build relationships and credibility. You earn and give respect so that you can collaborate with the team and persuade the right people of your recommendations. Oh, and since you get to do all of this remotely, from the comfort of your home, and you won’t be going into an office every day to wrangle the team—so your people and leadership skills are truly first class.

What you’ll be doing

Seeking constant opportunities to make our product offerings better

You’re the navigator, deciphering the map and telling the captains the best course to their destination.

Your mission is simple: comb through customer data to find the best areas for improvement, and relay that to the business side of the company. That means:
Building and monitoring metrics. You’ll work through requirements for surveys and dashboards, and monitor KPIs over time to identify trends and build models that explain how our customers interact with our organization and use our product.
Collaborating with the data and analytics group. On the other end of things, you’ll also help set up and automate data collection and aggregation to support analytical needs.
Presenting to stakeholders. Once you identify areas for improvement, you’ll need to present your case to the marketing or product team, explaining what the data tells us and how to make that campaign or product feature better (or discussing possible areas we need to dig deeper).
A few important caveats

This is a dream job, if you’re the right person for it.

Must-Have #1: You must be experienced. We’re looking for someone with 3-5 years of experience in a data scientist position, ideally with a degree in math, stats, or computer science. You must have a demonstrated track record of going from data exploration to analysis and presentation of recommended actions that resulted in a business improvement.

Must-Have #2: You must know the tools of the trade. You have a solid understanding of data manipulation and visualization, statistical analysis, predictive analytics, and customer segmentation—and the tools that go along with those. You can develop visualization dashboards in reporting tools such as Tableau like a pro, and you have experience with data science tools like Heap, Panda, SciKit, and others, as well as manipulate and analyze data in SQL and Python.

Must-Have #3: You must be comfortable collaborating and communicating. Your job extends beyond analyzing the numbers, so you’ll need to be just as comfortable presenting recommendations to others as you are digging through data on your own. In particular, you excel at translating technical concepts into business-driven advice.

Wondering if this is the right path for you?

Every year, professionals at the top of their field choose to join Precision Nutrition.

Here are some reasons why.

Reason #1: We give you the freedom to “do you.”

Unlike most companies, we don’t have rigid rules about how and when to do things. You’ll always be free to work independently, whenever, wherever, and however you want -- without the bureaucracy and office politics.

Reason #2: You can work from anywhere.

We’re a 100% remote company, and have been working remote for 17 years. We’re ideally looking for candidates in Canada, but will consider the US as well. When you join our team, you’re no longer shackled to one desk in one office!

Reason #3: Meetings are optional. (No, really.)

You’re an adult. You’re capable of deciding how your time should be spent. If you don’t think you need to attend a meeting, you don’t. Simple as that.

Reason #4: You’ll always feel supported.

In a regular office, it’s easy to feel like a hamster in a wheel, powerless to change things. At Precision Nutrition, we work as a team to overcome issues & barriers that stand in each other’s way, and we treat each other with enthusiasm, compassion, and care.

Reason #5: You’ll never be bored.

People often come to Precision Nutrition after hitting a plateau in their old jobs. At PN, you’ll get the chance to chart new territories in your space, conquer new challenges, learn from the best, and reach thrilling new heights of personal and professional growth.

Reason #6: You’re free to be you.

At Precision Nutrition, we want everyone to live healthier, happier lives—no matter your race, age, gender, religion, or sexual orientation. That's why diversity is a key ingredient of our workforce, so we can best represent the people we serve. Everyone is welcome—as an inclusive workplace, we want our employees to bring their authentic whole selves to work. Be you.

Reason #7: You’ll have autonomy.

Not every data scientist job allows you time in the driver’s seat, but with this position, you’ll be taking charge of the analytical projects related to our product, and even make up your own projects that help make us better. You’ll never be bored by the range of tasks you get to work on.

Plus: no commute ... and no 9-to-5 grind.
